# tavern-and-owner-generator

Originally, I was making this to be a simple console app using C++, but I thought to myself "Huh, what if I tried doing this via HTML and JS?" And... here we are.

This works by randomizing from several arrays (the tavern name will ALWAYS follow the structure "The [Adjective] [Noun]". 
There are different 'classifications' of taverns, we wouldn't want an upscale bar being named something the "The Crooked Rat" or "The Drenched Wolf"!

The nouns are also not classified but given their "ritzy" adjectives, they seem like something fantasy rich people would name a bar/inn/tavern. 
"Surpirse Me!" just chooses one of these classifications at random.


Then, the ability to randomly generate a barkeep/owner as well. Currently, this means a body weight, height, personality, and a quirk.


I may later add a way to get more decriptions, such as hair color/length, gender presentation, things of that nature...
